1. Technical Skills:

👉 Programming Languages:

👉 Python (for backend) or JavaScript (Node.js).

👉 Frontend Development:

👉 Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

👉 Experience with frameworks like React.js, Vue.js, or Vanilla JavaScript.

👉 Backend Development:

👉 Python frameworks like Flask or Django, or Node.js with Express.js.

👉 Understanding of RESTful API design and implementation.

👉 Database Knowledge:

👉 Basics of working with databases like MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.

👉 QR Code Generation:

👉 Familiarity with libraries for generating QR codes (qrcode for Python or qr-code-generator for JavaScript).

👉 API Integration:

👉 Basic understanding of building and consuming APIs.

👉 URL Shortening Algorithm:

👉 Understanding of encoding algorithms like Base62 for generating short URLs.

2. Software/Development Tools:

👉 Code Editor/IDE:

👉 Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or any preferred code editor.

👉 Version Control:

👉 Git and GitHub (for managing code and version control).

👉 GitHub repository setup for tracking project progress (or another version control platform).

👉 Environment Setup:

👉 Python 3.x installed on your system if using Python for the backend.

👉 Node.js and npm if using JavaScript/Node.js for the backend.

👉 Package Managers:

👉 pip for Python or npm for Node.js to manage project dependencies.

3. Required Libraries/Packages:

👉 Frontend:

👉 Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

👉 React or Vue.js if building a more interactive frontend.

👉 Backend:

👉 Python (Flask/Django):

👉 Flask or Django for handling requests and routing.

👉 qrcode for generating QR codes.

👉 hashids or similar library for generating short URLs.

👉 Node.js:

👉 express for handling backend routes.

👉 qr-image or qrcode for generating QR codes.

👉 shortid or nano-id for generating shortened URLs.

👉 Database:

👉 Install a database management system like:

👉 MongoDB (pymongo for Python, mongoose for Node.js).

👉 MySQL/PostgreSQL (sqlalchemy for Python, pg or mysql for Node.js).

👉 API Testing Tools:

👉Postman or cURL for testing API endpoints.

4. Cloud and Deployment Knowledge:

👉 Cloud Services:

👉Basic knowledge of deploying web apps on platforms like:

👉 AWS (EC2, Lambda, or other cloud services).

👉 Glitch or Cyclic (for simpler, cost-effective deployment).

👉 CI/CD Pipeline (Optional):

👉 If deploying on AWS or other platforms, understanding of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) would be useful.

👉 Tools like AWS CodePipeline, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.

5. Security and Optimization:

👉 Understanding how to enforce HTTPS and secure communication.

👉 Input validation techniques to avoid issues like malicious URLs.

👉 Optional: rate-limiting techniques to prevent service abuse.

6. Additional Tools (Optional):

👉 Docker: For containerizing the application, if required for easier deployment and scalability.

👉 Nginx: As a load balancer or reverse proxy (if not using serverless).

👉 Google Analytics or other analytics tools: For tracking the usage of shortened links.

👉 These prerequisites will provide you with the foundational tools and knowledge to develop, manage, and deploy the LQG-Link-Shortener-QR-Generator project effectively.
